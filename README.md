Hi! 

The package „paintCanvas“ is about event-management „from scratch“ using the AWT Framework. This is my personal approach to a homework proposed as a warm-up before taking part on a Java Bootcamp.

Run PaintingApp.java to get an empty black canvas where you can paint with the mouse using different colors chosen from a menu. The drawing should not disappear by changing the size, hiding or minimizing the window.
